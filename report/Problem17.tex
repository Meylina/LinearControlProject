In this problem, the discrete time feedback is tested on the nonlinear model. The controller has been implemented on the SIMULINK model of the nonlinear system (see figure \ref{fig:modelp17} in Appendix \ref{AppP17}).

The state responses to $x_{ref}$ has been plotted figure \ref{fig:p17time} in the time domain and figure \ref{fig:p17freq} in the frequency domain.

As we can see figure \ref{fig:p17time}, the reference is well tracked with a delay $\tau = 0.0034\ s$. Moreover, $u_e$ has also been plotted figure \ref{fig:p17time} and we can notice that $\max(u_e) \simeq 2 < 5\ V$, which respects the condition of the maximum voltage. The simulation has also been run with $Ax = 0.001\ m$ and $\max(u_e) \simeq 3.7 < 5\ V$ too.

Also, we can see figure \ref{fig:p17freq} that the harmonic distortion is attenuated. Indeed, we can see tab \ref{fig:tabTHD} that the percentage of the \textit{Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)} has decreased a lot, there is only 12\% of the initial THD left. Moreover, the distortion level of the second and third harmonic ($d_2$, $d_3$) have decreased a lot too (13 and 7\% left). Therefore, we can say that the controller succeeded in attenuating the harmonic distortion.
