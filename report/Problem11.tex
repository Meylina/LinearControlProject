In order to find $A_{i1}$ and $A_{i2}$, we started to implement the disturbance to the SIMULINK model (see figure \ref{fig:linearModelNoise}).

\end{figure}

Then, we have chosen $A_{i1}=5V$ and run the simulation to see the magnitude of the speak at 40$Hz$: $magnitude_{40Hz} = 0.2288\ V$. Knowing that the magnitude wanted is 0.0038 $V$ (determined with the nonlinear Model), we can find $A_{i1}=\frac{5*0.0038}{0.2288}=0.0830\ V$. In the same way, we find $A_{i2}=?\ V$.
